Distance from Civilization is a colony construction, management, and simulation game set in modern times.

DfC is built with the Unity engine and the C# language.

The main thematic setting of the game is based on modern-day Antarctic or Arctic outposts. For reference, see: Antarctica, Alaska, Northern Canada, Siberia, and Greenland. The player is tasked with the construction and operation of these facilities.

Typical gameplay tasks may include:

- Building new buildings
- Optimizing building layout
- Managing transportation (ground, ship, and air)
- Completing quests/tasks such as research
- Dynamically repairing facilities or moving crew around in response to weather events

Most bases will focus on one of the four main "pathways" (AKA "economies") for outpost development:

- *Habitation*: This area has attracted the general interest of the government, and they have sponsored you to colonize it. The more residents you gather, the more your funding grows.
  - Residents include employees, but eventually you want to start selling land for people to build their own houses. This is difficult because you need to set up sufficient "comforts of home" infrastructure first (water, sewage, regular food shipments, outside comms).

- *Industry*: This area contains valuable natural resources. You recieve direct funding based on how much you export. Simple.
  - Resources include oil, lumber, fish, and the minerals (coal, ore, and uranium).

- *Research*: This area contains something of scientific interest. You recieve funding for exporting data from science facilities, and for allowing outside researchers to visit.
  - Some facilities generate their own data. These are optical telescopes, radio telescopes, radiofrequency transmission arrays, weather radars, and weather observation stations.
  - Some facilities are used to process field data.
  - Field data is gathered from field experiments. Examples include launching of weather balloons, ground samples, air samples, samples of local plant life, archaeological work, or observation of local wildlife.

- *Military*: This area is at a location of military interest. You recieve funding for completing tasks given to you by the armed forces.
  - Typical military tasks include housing personnel, housing vehicles, or constructing something (radar, comms antenna, or missile launch platform).

The game is currently in early stages of development as a hobbyist project.
